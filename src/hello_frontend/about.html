            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm [K.Lavanya], a passionate web developer with a focus on creating user-friendly and responsive websites. I have a strong foundation in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy bringing creative ideas to life through code. In addition to web development, I have experience with backend technologies and databases, enabling me to work on full-stack projects.</p>
            <p>My journey in web development started with a curiosity to understand how websites work, which quickly evolved into a deep passion for coding and problem-solving. I'm constantly learning and improving my skills, and I love collaborating with others to build innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and honing my skills by working on personal projects. I'm always open to exciting opportunities to collaborate on challenging projects.</p>
